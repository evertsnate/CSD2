*The Walking Dead* takes place after the onset of a worldwide **[zombie apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse "Zombie apocalypse")**. The zombies, referred to as "walkers", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them. They are attracted to noise and to scents, including the scent of humans. Humans that are bitten or scratched by walkers die and become walkers themselves. Early in the series, it is revealed that all living humans carry the pathogen responsible for the mutation that turns humans into walkers. Therefore, any human who dies—regardless of the cause of death—will reanimate as a walker. The mutation is activated after the death of the pathogen's host. The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or to destroy the body entirely (e.g. via cremation).

Initially, the series centers on sheriff's deputy [Rick Grimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Grimes "Rick Grimes"), who wakes up from a [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma "Coma") in the first episode of the series. While Rick was comatose, the world was taken over by walkers. Rick becomes the leader of a group of survivors from the [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta"), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state) "Georgia (U.S. state)") region who attempt to sustain and protect themselves against attacks by walkers and against other groups of survivors willing to use any means necessary to stay alive.
